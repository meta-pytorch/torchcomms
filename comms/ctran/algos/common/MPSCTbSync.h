 * access. If it is with different GPUs, the memory must be pre-mapped for
 * direct P2P access.
 * See device-side Synchronization APIs in MPSCTbSyncDev.cuh
 *
 * Code struture:
 * - struct definition in .h to be included by both host and device sides.
 * - Host side allocates the memory, and device side actually uses it. Device
 *   member functions defined in *Dev.cuh.*/
