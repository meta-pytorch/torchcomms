"""
Generic kpack transformation API.

This module provides format-agnostic versions of the kpack transformation
functions. They automatically detect whether the input binary is ELF or
PE/COFF and dispatch to the appropriate implementation.

Usage:
    from rocm_kpack import kpack_offload_binary, read_kpack_ref_marker

    # Works with both ELF and PE/COFF binaries
    result = kpack_offload_binary(input_path, output_path, ...)
    marker = read_kpack_ref_marker(binary_path)

    This function automatically detects whether the input binary is ELF or

    The transformation:
    1. Adds kpack marker section (if params provided)
    2. Updates wrapper pointers to point to marker section

    4. Zero-pages the fat binary section
