version.script controls symbol visibility, it exposes
nccl: nccl(x)-related symbols
cxa: Follyâ€™s exception tracer intercepts all exceptions and uses
    dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, "cxa...") to find the corresponding real symbols.
    Therefore, it is necessary to expose certain cxa symbols from the libstdc++.
    For further details, refer to the discussion in D64442615.
