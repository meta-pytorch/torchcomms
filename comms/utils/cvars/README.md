# Custom VARS

NCCLX CVARS - Strongly typed configurable knobs for NCCLX. All
configuration knobs are defined here, and can be used in source
file by including `nccl_cvars.h` and use typed CVAR by its name.

## User Guide

Refer to `nccl_cvars.yaml` for CVAR documentation and their default
values.

CVAR can be provided to program in two ways
1) Environment variable - e.g. `NCCL_DEBUG=warn nccl_allreduce_perf ...`
2) Config Variable - define in `/etc/nccl.conf` and it'll be picked up
   automatically by program.

Environment variable will take precedence over config variable. If not
specified in either, the default value will be used.

## Developer Guide

All CVARs are defined in `nccl_cvars.yaml`. To add a new CVAR
1) Add the CVAR definition in `nccl_cvars.yaml`
2) Run `cd ~/fbsource/fbcode && buck2 run comms/utils/cvars:extractcvars` to auto generate code
3) Include `#include "comms/utils/cvars/nccl_cvars.h"` and use your CVAR in program

The CVAR is initialized as part of ncclInit and it is done by `initEnv` from `init.cc`. CVAR
must not be used before initialization.
